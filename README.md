# Reach React Template

This repository has many tools that you can use in your Reach projects, such as connect wallet button, faucet modals and a simple framework to build your own websites.

Or you can just tweak the files in the participant folder and the routes in App.js to configure the already working site for your needs.

Project uses React Hooks and Context for state management and Bootstrap for styling.
